"""User-journey definitions and the runners that time them.

A :class:`Journey` names a user-facing operation, an optional per-journey
``setup`` that returns a context object, and a ``measure`` coroutine — the
timed unit. :func:`run_latency` times ``measure`` sequentially; journeys marked
``concurrency_safe`` can also be driven by :func:`run_throughput` with many
operations in flight.

v1 journeys are pure HTTP/API (server + DB, no runner, no LLM):

- ``list_sessions`` — the session-list read behind the sidebar/home.
- ``create_session`` — session creation cost (POST then DELETE).
- ``get_session`` — single-session snapshot load.
- ``load_conversation_history`` — history read, seeded runner-free via
  ``external_conversation_item`` (see :meth:`BenchEnvironment.seed_items`).

The framework (``Journey`` + the two runners) is harness-agnostic and reused
verbatim by phase-2 full-turn journeys.
